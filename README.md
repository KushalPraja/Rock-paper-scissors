# **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game**

This program simulates a 5-round game of Rock-Paper-Scissors between a human player and the computer.

## **How It Works**
- The computer randomly selects one of the three options: "rock," "paper," or "scissors."
- The user is prompted to input their choice.
- The program compares the user's choice with the computer's choice and determines the winner for each round.

- At the end of 5 rounds, the program announces the final winner or a tie based on the scores.
